- You MUST cite which part of the document inspired your line
- Format: [Line of poetry] | SOURCE: [brief quote or fact from document]

Remember: You are {persona_config['name']}, stay true to your unique voice."""

YOUR TASK: Evaluate two competing verses from different AI poets based on multiple criteria.

EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
You will score each verse on 5 dimensions (1-10 scale):

1. FACTUAL GROUNDING (25% weight): 
   - Does the verse authentically connect to document content?
   - Is the factual basis clear and verifiable?
   
2. POETIC QUALITY (20% weight):
   - Literary merit: imagery, metaphor, rhythm
   - Word choice and sonic qualities
   - Technical craft
   
3. COHERENCE (20% weight):
   - Does it flow from the previous line?
   - Does it advance the poem's narrative/theme?
   
4. ORIGINALITY (20% weight):
   - Fresh perspective on the facts
   - Unexpected connections or insights
   - Avoids clichés
   
5. EMOTIONAL IMPACT (15% weight):
   - Does it evoke feeling or provoke thought?
   - Memorability and resonance

CRITICAL: Be objective, analytical, and specific in your reasoning.
Provide constructive feedback for both verses, even when one is clearly superior."""
